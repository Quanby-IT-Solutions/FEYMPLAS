# Fame+ Manila

Welcome to the **Fame+ Manila** project, a dynamic and modern web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This project aims to deliver a seamless experience for the Fame+ Manila platform, leveraging the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized performance.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

You can begin editing the application by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you make changes, thanks to Next.js's hot-reloading feature.

## Features

- **Optimized Performance**: Built with Next.js, utilizing server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for fast load times.
- **Custom Fonts**: This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimized font loading, including Google Fonts like Inter.
- **Developer Friendly**: Hot-reloading and modern build tools make development efficient and enjoyable.
